Causes of deaths have always been at the center of research worldwide. In the United States for instance, around 74% of all deaths originate as a result of either Heart disease, Cancer, Stroke and cerebrovascular diseases, and in some instance neonatal deaths. Statistical data collected have proven that for more than a decade, heart disease and cancer have claimed the first and second spots respectively as the leading causes of deaths in America. Together, the two causes are responsible for 46 percent of deaths in the United States. Third, comes chronic lower respiratory diseases. Together, they account for half deaths in the United States. Consequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been collecting and examining causes of death for over 30 years. This information helps researchers and doctors to take a better perspective when it comes to address growing epidemics in healthcare. Further, the data contribute to help understand how preventive measures may help people live longer and healthier lives.
